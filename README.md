# Accommodations-rating-platform
The platform was created within the context of the 'Object Oriented Programming' class of my university by a fellow student and me.
It can be used by 2 different types of users.Firtsly, by the so called 'providers' who have the ability to insert their accommodation's 
information and its amenities.Secondly,by 'simple users' who have the ability to see the different accommodations that are available,search for accommodations
with specific features (for example,hotel with view to the sea) and add ratings to them in the form of either a comment or a number.All the information
about the users and their activity,is stored in the save_file.dat file.Before the app starts to run ,save_file.dat is initialized.
