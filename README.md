# Accommodations-rating-platform
The platform was created within the context of the 'Object Oriented Programming' class of my university by a fellow student and me.
It can be used by 2 different types of users.Firtsly, by a so called 'providers' who have the ability to insert their accommodation's 
information and its amenities.Secondly,by 'simple users' who have the ability to see the diffrent accommodations that are available,search for accommodations
with specific features (for example,hotel located near the center of the town) and add ratings to them in the form of comment or number.
All the information about the users and their activity,is stored in the save_file.dat file.Before the app starts to execute ,save_file.dat is initialized.
